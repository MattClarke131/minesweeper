Minesweeper Notes

Questions
1. Where in the HTML should I store a template?
  1.1. I'm opting to keep it outside of the gameBoard to make it easier to
       only grab elements I want from gameBoard
2. When should I place helper functions within a larger functions, and when
   should I place them outside as _underscore functions?

Notes
