Shawn Notes

"Show me the data structures and I'll show you the algorithm"

git blame:
  Useful for figuring out why something changed
  Ex. flipping of y and x in _setGameValues. How did this bug get in the
    codebase?
  Syntax ex.:
    git blame controller.js
    (find line 36 (line with bug))
    git show (commit name)
    git blame (commit name)~1 -- controller.js (dig deeper, before commit)
      (-- separates arguments from files names)

terminal style:
  search "solarized"

git checkout -
  checkout the last branch/commit you were on

== vs ===
use two until you know when to use three

"use strict"
  Must be first line of file
    Can also be at the beginning of a function, but why do that?
  Requires var declarations

google let vs var

How to rename a git commit
  git rebase -i HEAD~10
    (shows last 10 commits)
  change pick to reword

MVC
"Can you play the game without using the controller?"
  The answer should be yes
"The controller shouldn't have game rules in it"

TO DO
Change closure variables to look within node
